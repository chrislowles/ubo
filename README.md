### [threads.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrislowles/ubo/refs/heads/main/threads.txt)
Aspects of Threads, an app by Meta that'll probably be shut down in a few years due to moderation bullshit they've let build up collapse in on itself.

Aspects of Wikipedia, I donate when I can so to get asked again is annoying.

YouTube Music, mostly just ways of filtering stuff going from normal YouTube so I can keep the UI relatively focused.

### [yt.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrislowles/ubo/refs/heads/main/yt.txt)
YouTube itself, this currently covers updates that fuck with general usability.
